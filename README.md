# deduplicate-object-list-assignment Assignment

## Objective
Implement 3 functions that get a random list and remove duplicate objects from that list, where each test run randomly selects a different list of objects.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Implement the `getRandomList` function in `src/dataHelper.js` including tests
4. Implement the `removeDuplicates` function in `src/dataHelper.js` including tests
5. Implement the `getUniqueDataFromAllLists` function in `src/dataHelper.js` including tests
6. Test your functions using Jest by running `npm test`.

## Requirements
- JavaScript knowledge, particularly with object comparison.
- Ensure that the output contains only unique objects.


## Running Tests
Run `npm test` to test your implementation.
